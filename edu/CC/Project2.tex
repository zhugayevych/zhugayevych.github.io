\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the mean-square length of linear alkanes C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$.
\item Equilibrate a water box using MM3 force field.
\item Using a case study show that for sufficiently large molecules microcanonical and canonical molecular dynamics simulations are nearly equivalent.
\item Study crystallization/vitrification of SiO$_2$.
\item What factors determine the preference between B1 and B2 structures of ionic crystals?
\item What factors determine the preference between B3 and B4 structures of covalent crystals?
\item What factors determine the preference between fcc, hcp and bcc structures of simple metals?
\item What factors determine stability of simple cubic lattice in average valence 5 crystals?
\item Compare cohesion energies of known TiO$_2$ polymorphs using various methods from empirical potentials and semiempirical Hamiltonians to DFT (various functionals).
\item Study secondary bonding in halogen crystals
\end{enumerate}

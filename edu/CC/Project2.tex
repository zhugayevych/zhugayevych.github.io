\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the mean-square length of a linear alkane C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$.
\item Equilibrate a water box for MM3 force field.
\item Using a case study show that for sufficiently large molecules microcanonical and canonical molecular dynamics simulations are nearly equivalent.
\item Evaluate stretching, bending, torsional strength of carbon nanotubes.
% Artem Naumov
\item Characterize and compare mechanical/structural parameters of at least
two different carbon nanotubes in the view of their possible application in structural composites.
\item Study crystallization/vitrification of SiO$_2$.
\item Find and characterize SiO$_2$ polymorphs.
\item Simulate Si nanocrystals in SiO$_2$.
\item What factors determine the preference between B1 and B2 structures of ionic crystals?
\item What factors determine the preference between fcc, hcp and bcc structures of simple metals?
\item Compare cohesion energies of known TiO$_2$ polymorphs using three methods: empirical COMB3 potential, semiempirical PM7 Hamiltonian, and PBE(GGA) density functional.
\end{enumerate}

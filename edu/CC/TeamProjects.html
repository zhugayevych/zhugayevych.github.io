<p class="note">This is a scientific project whose more or less complete solution has a complexity scale of a peer-reviewed publication. That is why a precise exhaustive solution is not required. But try to do your best, spending a reasonable amount of time (about 2 hours per week per team member). It is expected that you will take our advisory on these projects. Prepare 10 min oral presentation (introduction, motivation, methodology, main results, conclusions) and be ready for additional 10 min of discussion. Very short written report might be required and should contain the information on contribution of each team member.</p>

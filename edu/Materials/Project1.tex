Take a column in the periodic table of elements and explain trends in bonding, structure, and properties for crystals of these elements as we move down the column (or across the group of elements if it is not a column). Here is an exemplary list of choices in the order of complexity:

\begin{itemize}
\item Group 14 (C and below)
\item Group 15 (N and below)
\item Group 13 (B and below)
\item Group 16 (O and below)
\item Group 17 (F and below)
\item Group 1 (Li and below)
\item Group 2 (Be and below)
\item Group 18 (He and below) 
\item Transition metals: Ti to Ni
\item Transition metals: period 3 to 6
\item Cu/Zn to Au/Hg
\item Lanthanides
\item Actinides
\end{itemize}

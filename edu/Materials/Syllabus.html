<p><dfn>Description</dfn>: The course teaches fundamentals of modern Materials Science (Part I of the course) and provides a survey of materials (Part II, per-material-class introduction to Materials Science), covering all relevant Skoltech research areas and beyond, with brief explanation of structural, electronic, physical, chemical or other properties of materials relevant for their practical use, with focus on utilizing their unique properties in applications, briefly explaining also relevant methods of materials synthesis and characterization, device fabrication and optimization.</p>
<p>It is a core course in Materials Science educational track providing a reference knowledgebase for the rest of material-specific courses as well for student research.</p>
<p><dfn>Intended learning outcomes</dfn>:<br>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of fundamentals of modern Materials Science as required in the output of the educational track and as an input for the rest of material-specific courses.</li>
<li>Ability to understand and review scientific publications in Materials Science and Engineering as well as communicate orally or through writing the results of research to materials scientists and engineers.</li>
<li>Knowledge of major classes of technologically important materials including structure, functional properties, and practical use.</li>
<li>Ability to analyze and optimize existing materials, find practical use of them, and design new materials.</li>
<li>Part II of the course also gives students a flavor of what research in Materials Science is conducted at Skoltech and attracts students to this research.
    Informally, this is the place where everybody (students, professors, researchers) meets everybody in person under the umbrella of Materials Science.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><dfn>Assessment</dfn> (see details <a href="Assessment.html">here</a>, see <a href="../GradingSkoltech.html">grading scheme</a>):
<ul>
<li>4/15=27% &ndash; final project (presentation + discussion + science + report)</li>
<li>4/15=27% &ndash; 3 homeworks (there are 2 grades for two parts of HW2)</li>
<li>3/15=20% &ndash; 3 team projects</li>
<li>2/15=13% &ndash; Part I exam (theory + practice), everybody must pass it</li>
<li>2/15=13% &ndash; participation + scientific communication skills</li>
<li>For each assignment students will get a written or oral feedback except for: 'A'-graded works, 'B'-graded late submissions, submissions made after grading</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><dfn>Prerequisites</dfn>: The course relies on basic knowledge of physics or chemistry including quantum mechanics and statistical physics at undergraduate level, though most of the lectures should be understandable with only a general physics or chemistry background.

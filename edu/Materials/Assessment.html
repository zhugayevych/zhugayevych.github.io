<p><dfn>Assessment criteria</dfn> (what is considered as A, see also <a href="../GradingSkoltech.html">grading scheme</a>):
<ul>
<li>Homework: All tasks are completed accurately and in full, without redundancy.</li>
<li>Presentation: Scientific presentation style, content is delivered in full, without redundancy, slides are well organized and properly formatted.</li>
<li>Report: Scientific article style, content is delivered in full, without redundancy, conclusions are fully supported.</li>
<li>Research: Scholarly quality of your work including accurate and supported statements, knowledge of the subject, presented computed and measured data and facts are analyzed and rationalized.</li>
<li>Final project discussions: Ask 3 good questions/comments, bad questions/comments are counted with minus sign, clarifying questions are not counted.</li>
<li>Scientific communication skills: Clearly communicate your thoughts and answer questions using scientific language during presentations and discussions.</li>
<li>Participation: Active participation in all class activities (assessment period is not counted).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><dfn>Assessment rules</dfn>:<br>
<ul>
<li>Become familiar with Skoltech regulations on grading, academic integrity, and attendance.</li>
<li>For written submissions you will get written comments: every critical comment decreases your grade by one level in the row A/B/C/D/F.</li>
<li>For homeworks if, let say, 8 completed tasks correspond to A, then B corresponds to 6.5 completed tasks. If majority of students failed on a given task, that task is excluded from downgrading.</li>
<li>Identical homework solutions are not counted.</li>
<li>Additional homework tasks may be taken during assessment week to improve grades (C and lower): submit a single request for all tasks by email or via shared Google sheet. The deadline is 1 day after you obtained your last homework evaluated. Then all requests are processed and extra homework is uploaded <a href="HomeworkExtra.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>Team projects can be resubmitted by email two times.</li>
<li>Do not forget that any resubmissions or extra tasks can not only increase but also decrease your grade.</li>
<li>Final projects are assessed as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>40% &ndash; written report (75% content, 25% presentation)</li>
  <li>40% &ndash; oral presentation (50% content, 25% presentation, 25% discussion)</li>
  <li>20% &ndash; discussion of other projects</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

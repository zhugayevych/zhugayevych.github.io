\title{Team project 2, due dates are set in Course schedule and Canvas LMS \\ Topic: Structural types}
\maketitle

Analyze a structural type or a class of structural types: definition, structure, bonding, structure-property relationships, structural trends, related structural types, what kind of materials prefer this structure and why these materials prefer this structure etc. Here is an exemplary list of choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item Close-packed structures (metals)
\item Close-packed structures (alloys)
\item Closely copacked compounds (ionic crystals)
\item Tetrahedrally coordinated lattices (Si etc.)
\item Inorganic sheets and layered crystals (graphene etc.)
\item Inorganic polymers (Se etc.)
\item Crystals of diatomic molecules
\item High-pressure polymorphs of Si
\item High-pressure polymorphs of P
\item Perovskites (deformations)
\item As/GeTe structural type (deformations)
\item Rutile structure
\item Chalcopyrite structure
\end{itemize}

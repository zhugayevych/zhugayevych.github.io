2. -43m; x(C1),x(C2),x(H1),x(H2),z(H2) or C1-C2 bond, C1-H1 and C2-H2 bonds, C1-C2-C1 and H2-C2-H2 angles

3. Adamantane, it can be considered as prototype

4. The bonding is covalent. Bond lengths and angles correspond to sp3-hybridized carbon. Coordination corresponds to the diamond lattice.

5. See adamantane_predicted.xyz
The structure is predicted assuming perfect tetrahedral coordination of C2 atoms and polyethylene bondlengths CC=1.53 and CH=1.09. The comparison with the reference structure shows high accuracy of the prediction:
       ref  predicted
CC    1.544   1.53
CH1   1.098   1.09
CH2   1.099   1.09
CCC  109.73  109.47
HCH  106.85  109.47

6. The structure is rigid (there are no low-energy confirmations). At ambient conditions molecules pack into fcc lattice with full-symmetry orientational disorder (Fm-3m). At low temperatures all atoms are ordered and symmetry is lowered to P-421c. Noticeable molecules with C10H16 formula include monoterpenes.

7. Being non-pi-conjugated hydrocarbon, it should have high HOMO-LUMO gap. Frontier orbitals correspond to CCsp3 bonds and antibonds, and can be triply degenerate.

8. It is the smallest molecular model of void in the diamond lattice.

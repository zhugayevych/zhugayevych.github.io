2. I41/amd; a,c,z(O)

3. Anatase, it is prototype, C5, tI12

4. The bonding is ionic-covalent. According to ionic bonding, oxygens form fcc lattice and Ti occupy half of octahedral voids. According to covalent bonding, under crystal symmetry restrictions, three O-Ti bonds emerging from oxygen repulse each other increasing octahedral angles to 102 deg.

Comparison: 2 predicted Ti-O bonds are in perfect agreement with the DFT structure (2.01 Ao), whereas another 4 are slightly shorter (1.96 Ao). Distortion of octahedral angles has been discussed above.

6. Under ambient conditions, the lowest energy TiO2 polymorph is rutile, but anatase readily appears under some processing conditions.

7. It is wide-gap semiconductor.

8. Because of its porous structure with continuous ion-diffusion network, TiO2 can be used as electrode in Li-ion batteries (as anode because of low electrode potential of Ti reduction).

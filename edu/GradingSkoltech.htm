<p>Detailed description of grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "Excellent" (90-105): The work examined is outstanding and provides evidence of excellent performance demonstrating a superior understanding of the subject matter, a foundation of extensive knowledge, and a skillful use of concepts and/or materials. All Learning Outcomes are satisfied at a high level.</li>
<li>B "Good" (75-90): The work is of high standard and provides evidence of comprehensive knowledge and good performance demonstrating capacity to use the appropriate concepts, a good understanding of the subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and materials encountered in the subject. All Learning Outcomes are satisfied and a majority satisfied at a high level.</li>
<li>C "Satisfactory" (60-75): The work examined is generally satisfactory and provides evidence of adequate performance demonstrating a sufficient understanding of the subject matter however with notable shortcomings. Majority of the learning outcomes are satisfied at an appropriate level.</li>
<li>D "Poor" (50-60): The work examined is poor and provides evidence of very limited familiarity with the subject matter, insufficient knowledge and significant shortcomings. The evidence shows that only some of the Learning Outcomes are satisfied at an appropriate level.</li>
<li>F "Unacceptable" or "Fail" (&lt;50): The submission is absent, or the work examined is unacceptable and provides insufficient evidence of knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. The evidence fails to show that any of the Learning Outcomes are satisfied at an appropriate level.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assessment and grading rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>All grades are printed in <em>Grades Sheet</em> available anytime you see Course Instructor (together with graded works and comments). Grades in Canvas are approximate and can be wrong due to technical failures of Canvas which is uncontrollable by Instructor.</li>
<li>Empty positions in Grades Sheet are excluded from counting towards final grade.</li>
<li>All 'F's must be fixed to pass a course unless specific 'F's are explicitly allowed by Instructor as exceptions.</li>
<li>Late submissions are downgraded progressively (i.e. the larger the delay the lower the grade).</li>
<li>Identical solutions are discarded.</li>
<li>Absolute grading scheme of homeworks is based on principle that 'C' corresponds to 50% ("majority of the learning outcomes are satisfied at an appropriate level"). This translates into the following grid (max 10pts): 9pts=A, 7pts=B, 5pts=C, 3pts=D.</li>
</ul>

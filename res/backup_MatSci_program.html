<p>Materials Science is an interdisciplinary educational track at Skoltech relating to research in various focus areas including Advanced Materials, Energy, Space, Biology, Computations. The broad educational program builds upon several courses taught by faculty members of <a href="http://crei.skoltech.ru/cest">Center for Energy Science and Technology</a> and elective courses delivered by members of other CREIs including <a href="http://crei.skoltech.ru/cpqm">Center for Photonics and Quantum Materials</a> and <a href="http://crei.skoltech.ru/cdmm">Center for Design, Manufacturing and Materials</a>. Our lecturers conduct cutting edge research in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science">Materials Science</a> as evidenced by high median h-index ~30. In addition to the specialized expertise, the program delivers an interdisciplinary mix of engineering and natural sciences that is unique for the universities in Russia and beyond. Other core aspects of the program are industry immersion and the entrepreneurship and innovation component. Skoltech offers international environment and the opportunities for students to visit foreign universities and international conferences.</p>

Firstly, the fundamental physical phenomena are considered that occur at different scales in the main classes of applied materials: metals, ceramics, polymers, natural materials, composites, and hybrids. Next, the interrelation between thermodynamics, diffusion kinetics, and deformation behavior is explored. The concept of structure is introduced, and the nature of structural elements at the atomic, molecular, nano-, micrometer and macroscopic scales is discussed: short and long range order in amorphous materials and crystals, defects, crystallites, grains and subgrains, precipitates, grain boundaries, interfaces, spherulites, etc. These are used to demonstrate the principal approaches to property control and evaluation in materials engineering and related technologies: chemical composition, synthesis, fabrication, heat treatment, plastic deformation, hybridization, and surface engineering.</p>

<p>Principles to control the properties are translated in terms of design performance applicable to the diverse classes. Ashby’s material selection algorithm for rational selection of materials for specific designs and applications will be taught here in comprehensive way - analysis of function, objectives and constraints, deducing of performance indices. All the concepts covered in lectures will be practiced by using CES EduPack a software to implement data intensive learning.</p>

<p>The lectures will be supported with a number of laboratory practical lessons devoted to the development of practical skills in traditional materials science research flow – the visualization, characterization and modification of structure followed by the testing and analysis of properties. All concepts covered in lectures will be the subject of exercises using open source software to implement data intensive learning. Individual projects (problems) will be formulated to introduce the CDIO approach in Applied Materials and Design.</p>

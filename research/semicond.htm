<h1>Inorganic semiconductors</h1>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">Semiconductors</a> are materials with a bandgap and variable electronic conductivity used as the core component of optoelectronic devices. Several classes of semiconductors are distinguished by nature of participating electrons, see <a href="semiconductors.pdf">these slides</a>.</p>

<h2>Mechanisms of light- and current-induced phenomena in pnictide and chalcogenide semiconductors</h2>
<p>Amorphous pnictide and chalcogenide semiconductors (As, Se, As2Se3, Ge2Sb2Te5 etc., see the <a href="fig_PerTab.png">diagram</a> and <a href="../Lib/MS/_spec/Chalcogenides/index.htm">Library</a>) exhibit significant photo- and current-induced changes whose nature is not well understood thus limiting the potential applications of the phenomenon (see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-change_memory">phase-change memory</a>).</p>

The secondary bonding is significant in these electron-rich semiconductors and results in strong redistribution of electronic density diminishing the difference between front and back bonds.</li>

We show that strong secondary bonding in pnictides and chalcogenides results in the coordination defects linearly extended over several front and back bonds. Front-back <a href="fig_coodef3.png">bond switching</a> makes the defects mobile which is the underlying mechanism of photo- and current-induced structural changes. Valence alternation pairs (VAP) of such coordination defects have very low energy, they are topologically stable and mobile via bond switching.</li>

<h2>Optical properties of nanostructured silicon: Origin of anomalously slow decay of phosphorescence in porous silicon</h2>
<p>Nanostructured silicon (porous-Si, Si nanocrystals in SiO2, Si nanowires etc., see the <a href="../Lib/MS/_spec/nanoSi/index.htm">Library</a>) raised a wave of scientific activity in 1990 as the promising material for silicon based optoelectronics. The kinetics of the <a href="fig_afterglow.png">phosphorescence decay</a> of a porous silicon in a wide temperature range is anomalously slow (the integral over the extrapolated signal diverges). This phenomena is observed in some conjugated polymers, but the existing explanation as the tunneling recombination of geminate electron-hole pairs requires an unnatural distribution of activation energies for porous silicon: wide, flat, with depression at small energies.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../pub/Blonsky03.pdf">New mechanism of charge carriers localization in silicon nanowires, Physics of Low-Dimensional Structures, n. 7/8, 25 (2003)</a>: We demonstrate that this is a generic feature of disordered systems with significant initial separation of the recombining particles: it is their multiple retrapping which is responsible for the depression of the distribution of activation energies. The comprehensive theory is published in <a href="../pub/index.htm">PhD thesis</a>.</li>

<h2>Inverse problem for the luminescence</h2>
<p>The analysis of the luminescence response is one of the easiest tools for studying the physical properties of materials. In particular, much information can be obtained by deconvoluting the time curve of the luminescence decay. The deconvolution is nontrivial, except the case of the multi-exponential decay, since the numerical inverse-Laplace transformation is mathematically incorrect problem.</p>

This method <a href="fig_phi4porSi.png">applied for porous silicon</a> is consistent with the <a href="fig_TSL.png">measurements of the thermally stimulated luminescence</a> complementing the latter at small activation energies. The comprehensive theory is published in <a href="../pub/index.htm">PhD thesis</a>.</li>

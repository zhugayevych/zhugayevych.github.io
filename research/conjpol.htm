<h1>Organic semiconductors</h1>

<p>Organic materials steadily break into the market of electronic devices (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_electronics">organic electronics</a>) as cost effective solution. Ease of production and recycling, enhanced molecular engineering, light weight and flexibility are additional advantages of organic electronics over inorganic. The electronic properties of these materials are determined by the &pi;-conjugated system (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_polymer">conductive polymer</a>).</p>

<h2>Structure prediction</h2>
<p>One of the challenges of computer-aided design of new materials is prediction of their structure. For organic semiconductors, due to their pronounced polymorphism and complex bulk structure, it is notoriously tough problem.</p>

<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11271">J Phys Chem C 122, 9141 (2018)</a>: We have identified all low-energy crystalline polymorphs of the archetypal conjugated polymer, regioregular poly-3-hexylthiophene (rr-P3HT) using the best available density functional theory methods benchmarked against the ab initio coupled cluster method. In addition we have resolved structure of known polymorphs (atomic positions were impossibe to fully determine from available experimental data).</li>

<h2>Solar cells</h2>
<p>One of the most promising applications is in photovoltaics. A low-cost implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_solar_cell">organic solar cells</a> is based on <a href="fig_BHJ.png">bulk-heterojunction</a> of &pi;-conjugated molecular donor and fullerene-based acceptor: the solar radiation is absorbed by the first component resulting in the creation of an exciton migrating to the interface where the exciton is split into the hole and electron transported to the electrodes by the donor and acceptor respectively. The complex multiscale morphology of this device limits the ability of experimental approaches to pinpoint the power conversion losses and thus to avoid the blind search of highly efficient devices. In this situation a theoretical study becomes an essential complementary tool of investigation.</p>

<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp310855p">J Phys Chem C 117, 4920 (2013)</a>: We perform first-principles study of light absorption, exciton and charge carrier transport in polycrystalline small-molecule based donors. Our results show that there are no power conversion losses on a single-crystallite scale. Thus the main efforts should be put in improving the mesoscale morphology of the active layer.</li>
